Here you'll find almost all the things I've googled and all the problems I faced doing this project.
I hope such a log helps me next time :)

[What the hell is `.sudo_as_admin_successful`?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/813942/is-it-possible-to-stop-sudo-as-admin-successful-being-created)

[Adding ssh-key](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to GitHub:

1. Don't forget to [run `ssh-add`](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. Clonning the repo via ssh is the easiest way to configure repo to use ssh key
